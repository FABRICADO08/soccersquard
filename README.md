Adrianâ€™s current app only administers the team members of each team. Each team has staff to manage and support the team. The staff members are just like a team member, a person, but have specific information which differs from a team member such as a coach certification and license number.
In this exercise, you will extend the app with staff members using inheritance so that both team members and staff can be handled equally, but with their specialized details
